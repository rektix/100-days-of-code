# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:

**Thoughts**: Today I start #100DaysofCode challenge. My goal is to finish all the courses I have started, build advanced bookmarks web app, start working on my game, learn algorithms and data structures, practice for competition and upgrade my skills in general. I start with a few algorithmic problems. Spend quite some time doing those problems but it was worth it. Those were not too hard but I still learned a few things. I gotta get ready for competition, after that I'll build python program for adding new journal entries and do some courses.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:

**Thoughts**: Today I start #100DaysofCode challenge. My goal is to finish all the courses I have started, build advanced bookmarks web app, start working on my game, learn algorithms and data structures, practice for competition and upgrade my skills in general. I start with a few algorithmic problems.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Did some algorithmic problems

**Thoughts**: Today I start #100DaysofCode challenge. My goal is to finish all the courses I have started, build advanced bookmarks web app, start working on my game, learn algorithms and data structures, practice for competition and upgrade my skills in general. I start with a few algorithmic problems. Spend quite some time doing those problems but it was worth it. Those were not too hard but I still learned a few things. I gotta get ready for competition, after that I'll build python program for adding new journal entries and do some courses.

### Day 5: April 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 4th place on republic competition in programming

**Thoughts**: It was really hard competition. I didn't expect ill do it that good. I used Pascal so it was a bit hard to do some stuff. First problem was with linked lists which I implemented for the first time, using 2 arrays. Second was ad-hoc and third was LCS. I saw huge improvement in my skills compared to past years.

### Day 6: April 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Improved motion detector python app by adding visualization with Bokeh

**Thoughts**: Finally got some time to relax from competetive programming by doing some python.

### Day 7: April 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learned basics of Requests and BeautifulSoup

**Thoughts**: Getting into webscraping, it looks pretty interesting so far.

### Day 8: April 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Practising webscraping

**Thoughts**: Yep, it is fun, but I was too lazy all day and did it quite late so it wasnt as long as I wanted it to be. I gotta change my habits.

### Day 9: April 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Webscraping project

**Thoughts**: This was quite easy project, taught me how to do this in practice, might upload to github someday.

### Day 10: April 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Python web app front-end

**Thoughts**: Today I started making Python Flask web app that collects users heights and sends them email with average height of all users who submitted their data. Quite a lot to learn here!

### Day 11: April 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Python web app database setup

**Thoughts**: Things that I have to do at back-end seem quite interesting, this shall be fun! But I had some problems with setting up databases but managed to work it out in the end.

### Day 12: April 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Python web app finished

**Thoughts**: I had much trouble with setting up this entire app on Heroku. Had problems with letting my email send automated mails from unknown machine (heroku server), but I pulled it out and it's working fine now. Tomorrow I'm taking a break with friends, shall continue after that.
